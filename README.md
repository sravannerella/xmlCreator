# xmlCreator - Alpha Test.
This is a csv to XML Item generator file written in Java. 

### HOW TO USE
- You need an csv file which is separated with `~~`.
- You need to update the filenames in the code and then compile the code.
- Once the class file is generated. 
- Run with the java file.


### Things to do:
The parser.java file is written in 5 minutes. Hence the filenames are hardcoded.

- The code will be updated with the arguments for ease of use.
- The code will generate based on different tag names. This will be integrated with arguments too.

### GOAL:

Run a java command like this.
`java parser inputFile.csv output.xml tagName`
